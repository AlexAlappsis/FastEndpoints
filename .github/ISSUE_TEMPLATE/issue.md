**Describe your issue:**

Please use code samples as much as possible when describing the issue. That helps us easily reproduce the problem on our end just by copy-pasting the code you've provided. 
If the problem is complex, please attach a minimalistic, debuggable, self contained repro project with just the bare minimum number of endpoints and dependencies showcasing the issue. 
Don't just copy/paste classes from your actual project. Try to reduce the noise by simplifying the code so that a person not familiar with your problem domain can understand the issue without much effort. 

**Requests not adhering to the above may take longer to get a response or will be automatically closed if seen as a low effort report.**
